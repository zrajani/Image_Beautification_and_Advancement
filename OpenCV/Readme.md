# Installation of OpenCV 

Host Machine: Ubuntu (Linux) 18.04LTS 

### Basic Installation on Linux 

To start the installation we first need to keep in mind that we need to make sure that we have g++ and build configuration tool i.e. make installed. 

If you don't have it already installed use the following commands 

<ul> Install g++ </ul>

	`sudo apt install -y g++`

<ul> OpenCV uses CMake build configuration tool </ul>

	`sudo apt install -y cmake`
